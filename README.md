The aim of this project is to compare the performance of an SVM trained on the different graph kernel, with
or without the manifold learning step, on the following data-sets:

- PPI: protein-protein interaction network where proteins are nodes and edge connect
    the proteins which have physical or functional association
- Shock: are graphs of 2D shapes

The algorithm implemented are:

- Graph Kernels: deal with graph model and permit to express data in graphs
    with several kernels
- Mainfold Learning: deal with raw data and permit the non-linear reducing of
    dimensionality

### Getting Started
The program is implemented in Python 3.7 and the perquisites are to install the following packages:

* opencv 3.4+
* numpy 1.18+
* scipy 1.4+
* moviepy 1.0+
