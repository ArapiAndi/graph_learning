Aim: compare the performance of an SVM trained on thedifferentgraph kernel, with
or without the manifold learning step, on the following data-sets:

- PPI: protein-protein interaction network where proteins are nodes and edge connect
    the proteins which have physical or functional association
- Shock: are graphs of 2D shapes

The algorithm to implement are:

- Graph Kernels: deal with graph model and permit to express data in graphs
    with several kernels
- Mainfold Learning: deal with raw data and permit the non-linear reducing of
    dimensionality
